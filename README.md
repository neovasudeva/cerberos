# Let's get *Kraken*!

**Kraken** is a small multi-core operating system written in C targeting x86-64. Kraken is built from scratch and is in its early stages of development.
To see what features are currently implemented and what features are planned for the future, refer to the Roadmap section. 

There are two main goals of this project:
1. **Completeness** - I would like to have Kraken support features typically found in modern operating systems. This includes implementing a networking stack, desktop environment, and SMP among other things. In addition, I would like Kraken to run on real hardware and eventually support RISC-V, so that I'm forced to rid the OS of architecture-dependent code.
2. **Learning** - Of course, I learned quite a bit from my OS course in university and we built our own minimal kernels. However, it lacked many features, I had not completely understood many concepts, and I was generally left unsatisfied (... and confused). This project is my attempt to rectify the misunderstandings I had while also learning more about OS development.
