## Objective
cerberos is a project I intend to use to learn about the internal structures of operating systems. Of course, I took an OS course in university, but I still didn't feel confident about what the OS was doing underneath the hood. 

This document will serve as a diary of some sense of my journey building cerberos, a reference when I inevitably forget the steps I went through to build portions of the operating system, and also as a guide for other hobbyist programmers interested in building an operating system. I will also constantly link resources I found helpful so other's don't have to scour Google for their questions.

## The setup

## Bootloader 

## Loading the GDT

## Interrupts and the IDT

## Paging and Virtual Memory
